1. By writing unit tests. Can use built in unittest library

2. By using separation of concern principles (OOP, modules etc). The code I provided is already properly organized. But to scale the application and add more functionality it can be organized even further for example moving all the validators to a separate file etc

3. By using python performance monitoring tools, like time.perf_counter() and timeit modules. Using those we can track the performance of our python code and tune it. Note: API performance not only depends on the underlying python code, it also strongly depends on the web server used like Nginx and the server load etc.

4. To optimize for GET requests we can use server-side caching. This way we can reduce the time it took for DB ops.
To optimize for post requests, we have to optimize the server to DB connection. We can async queries and use faster concurrent DBs like Postgres and MSSQL Server

5. Yup. The average power rating per day is being calculated for every request, which is wasteful. It can be stored in DB or can be cached on the server.
